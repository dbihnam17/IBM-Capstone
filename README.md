# IBM Data Science Capstone Project: Predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 Landings 🚀

This repository contains the final project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The capstone focuses on using historical launch data to predict the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage landings.

## 📌 Project Objective

The reusability of rocket boosters is critical for lowering the cost of space exploration. This project aims to predict whether a Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land its first stage, using machine learning models trained on publicly available data.
